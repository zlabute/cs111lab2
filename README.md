# You Spin Me Round Robin

This program simulates how a round robin program would run a set of prgorams with a given quantum length as well as given arrival times and burst times.

## Building

```shell
make
```

## Running

cmd for running TODO
```shell
./rr file.txt quantum_length

i.e.

./rr processes.txt 3
```

results TODO

The results of the average waiting time and average response time of all the processes is output.

Average waiting time: 7
Average response time: 2.75

```shell

```

## Cleaning up

```shell
make clean
```
